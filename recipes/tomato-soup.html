            <li>1/2 onion diced (1 cup)</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp fine sea salt</li>
            <li>1/4 freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh basil</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons salted butter</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 quart vegetable broth</li>
            <li>Optional: 1/4 to 1/2 cup heavy cream.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Lightly grease a large baking sheet, set aside.</li>
            <li>Combine tomatoes, onion, and garlic in a large bowl. Toss with olive oil, salt and pepper and stir until evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>Spread tomato mixture onto prepared baking sheet in a single layer and roast for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven, stir, and roast for an additional 15 minutes, broiling during the last 3 minutes so that some of the tomatoes get lightly charred.</li>
            <li>Add roasted tomato mixture to the container of a high-powered blender, making sure to scrape all the contents of the baking sheet into the blender.</li>
            <li>Add fresh basil and blend mixture on high speed until smooth (about 50 seconds).</li>
            <li>In a large pot, melt butter over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Add flour to melted butter and whisk to combine. Cook until butter and flour mixture is golden brown (30-60 seconds).</li>
            <li>Add broth and sugar and whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Add blended mixture to the pot and whisk to combine. If desired (for a creamier soup) add ¼ to ½ cup heavy cream. Cook over medium-low heat for 15 minutes, taste and adjust salt and pepper as desired.</li>
            <li>Serve warm with croutons, chopped fresh basil, etc.</li>
        </ol>
