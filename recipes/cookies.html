        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Everyone knows, and loves, chocolate chip cookies, but today's recipes often leave much to be desired. They either try to reinvent the wheel or go with too simple of a cookie. The balance between this two is where the perfect cookie lies, and where we'll be cooking today.We'll be making the cookie we all imagine when thinking of one: crunchy but chewy, soft but solid, and most importantly sweet and delicious.</p>
        <p>Easy and simple to make.</p>
