# Basic recipe website for the Odin Project

In short, this is a project that has gone through many editions; each improving the website significantly.

1st - Basic html

This project is the first of many I will create in my journey following the Odin Project's curriculum. Although, at least for now, very basic in code and structure, this may be the most important project I will ever do, as it's my first one. At the moment, I have only learned the basics of html - some basic tags such as headings, paragraphs, links and images - and while everything is very simple so far this project marks the beginning of my coding journey, therefore in many aspects being the most important I will ever do. 

Besides practicing my html skills, I also practiced how to organize a project - file structure -, how to use git and github, more specifically how to create a repository, set it up locally and then doing meaningful commits that do my project justice; how to push a project to github and then how to view it in the web. Overall, this project allowed me to do something that was uniquely mine, and although easy, it was extremely satisfying.

2nd - Basic css

This time around I implemented the little css I know mostly to practice as the appearance didn't really improve much. I only changed the following properties: color, background-color, font-size and font-family.

3rd - A step up in css

Although again, done with very very basic css, this time around I improved the appearance of the home page - when looked at 50% browser width, since that's how I was working with it and I haven't yet learned how to make a website responsive.

Next steps: 

Improve the look of individual recipe's pages, add more of them for layout purposes, and make the website responsive. Also in the future I would like to give a complete overhaul, with a theme to the website's appearance.
