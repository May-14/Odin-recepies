# Basic recipe website for the Odin Project

This project is the first of many I will create in my journey following the Odin Project's curriculum. Although, at least for now, very basic in code and structure, this may be the most important project I will ever do, as it's my first one. At the moment, I have only learned the basics of html - some basic tags such as headings, paragraphs, links and images - and while everything is very simple so far this project marks the beginning of my coding journey, therefore in many aspects being the most important I will ever do. 

Besides practicing my html skills, I also practiced how to organize a project - file structure -, how to use git and github, more specifically how to create a repository, set it up locally and then doing meaningful commits that do my project justice; how to push a project to github and then how to view it in the web. Overall, this project allowed me to do something that was uniquely mine, and although easy, it was extremely satisfying.

At the end, I added basic css, with a main purpose of practicing, but also for it to look more presentable.
